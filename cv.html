    <h3>Thesis</h3>
    <p>Raman studies of Metal doped Nanodiamonds (2009)</p>
    <h3>Master's Thesis Description</h3>
    <p>Raman spectroscopy is a famous, non-destructive tool for structural characterization of carbon materials like diamond, graphite, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and disordered, nanostructured and amorphous carbons. It is widely used to characterize the phonon modes of the different allotropes and non-crystalline phases of carbon.
 Nanodiamonds retain very important applications, including ultrathin, ultrahard coatings, nanocomposites, nanobearings, and materials for field emission displays. The size of the nanodiamond clusters first suggested by Badziag was less than about 5 nm which may be more stable than graphite.
 	The Raman spectra of ultradispersed nanodiamonds produced by the detonation technique have been measured with argon ion laser of wavelength 514.5 nm and helium neon laser of wavelength 632.8 nm. Samples of two types which differ in their kinetics of detonation product cooling were investigated. Some of the samples intercalated with copper have also been studied. The structural transitions were identified by Raman spectra. The spectra exhibit the basic features, the density of state feature of diamond at ~1230 cm<sup>-1</sup>, the nanodiamond band at ~ 1322 cm<sup>-1</sup>, and the G band around 1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>. We then discussed the assignment of the peaks at ~ 1150 and 1480 which were often observed in nanodiamonds. We also illustrated the peak at ~1758 cm<sup>-1</sup>. We discussed a peak at ~990 cm<sup>-1</sup> which was only seen by the helium neon laser in some samples. The dispersion of the peak positions and intensities with excitation wavelength is used to understand the nature of resonant Raman scattering and how to derive the local bonding and disorder from Raman spectra. The G peak shows strong dispersion and the nanodiamond peak is not dispersive in our samples. The great advantage of the Raman spectroscopy will be clarified by a series of examples. In particular we show how it can be used to probe the structural changes induced by the annealing and by the intercalation of copper.

 <h3>Built a new Detector at Lund university (2011)</h3>
 <p>Research Project Lund University Sweden
 I have built a new detector for X-ray scattering measurements on nanoparticles in flames.
  Small-Angle and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS and WAXS) are used together to measure nanoparticles in-situ in combustion. X-rays have typically a wavelength of 1–2 Å (0.1–0.2 nm). SAXS measurement can provide the size distribution of particles in the range between 1 and 100 nm and WAXS yield information about the structure of the particles. Measurements on soot formation in a flame are performed by combining these two methods. Two detectors are being developed and built for the experiments, which combine these two techniques. The goal of the project is to build a new detector for X-ray scattering measurement in order to expand the measuring range. Test experiments will be run at Max-lab to determine the characteristics of the new detector.
